# Trajectory-Tracker

This project simulates the motion of a particle in a rotating reference frame, influenced by the gravitational forces of two massive bodies. 

## Features 
 - Implements a normalized gravitational constant for simplicity.
 - Simulates motion using the Runge-Kutta method (`RK45`) via `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`.
 - Visualizes results with plots of:
  - Particle trajectory.
  - Total energy over time to validate conservation laws.


## Prerequisites 
 - Python 3.x
 -  Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `scipy`
  - `matplotlib`

 Install dependencies using pip : `pip install matplotlib scipy numpy`


## Usage 
 1. Clone the repository 
 2. Run each cell in the ipynb file 


## Contribution
Feel free to fork the project, suggest improvements, or report issues.
